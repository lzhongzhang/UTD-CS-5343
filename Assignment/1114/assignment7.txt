Chapter 7


1) For the list shown below, illustrate each of following sorts as shown in the slide(s) listed:
   64, 32, 79, 83, 67, 46, 96, 55, 68, 12

   10 points:  a) Insertion sort (slide 5)
   15 points:  b) Shell sort with sequence 5,3,1 (slides 14, 15, 16)
   10 points:  c) Merge sort  (as slide 30)
   10 points:  d) Radix sort (as slide 59).

   Note:  continue each until the final list is sorted!

15 points
2) For the list shown below, demonstrate the following sort:
   64, 12, 68, 23, 97, 38, 81, 76, 55, 32, 48, 29, 46

   Quick sort  (as slide 45).  Use median-of-three and continue
         until the list is sorted.  If a partition size is <= 3, just
         put the partition in sorted order.

3) For the list shown below, demonstrate the following sort:
   8, 7, 4, 2, 5, 5, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8
   Bucket sort (as slide 57).

10 points
4) For the list shown below, demonstrate the following sort:
   10, 1, 5, 2, 6, 8, 4, 10, 6, 6, 2, 4, 1, 8, 7, 3
   External sort (as slide 61).  Use a run size of 4.

   Note:  continue until the final list is sorted!

10 points
5) For the list below, what runs would be created if M=3 using
   replacement selection?

   10, 1, 5, 2, 6, 8, 4, 10, 6, 6, 2, 4, 1, 8, 7

10 points
6) Suppose 4 items are to be compared.  How many leaves would the decision tree have for this number of items?  How many comparisons at worst would it take to sort them?

4 items have 4! possible arrangements. this leads to a tree with 4! = 24 leaves, thus log(4!) depth, and therefore log(4!) comparisons. therefore the number of comparisons required is 5.
